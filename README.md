# Active-Directory-Fundamentals
This project documents my hands-on work in Windows &amp; Active Directory Fundamentals labs.  The focus was on learning how to configure and manage **Active Directory (AD DS)**, apply **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**, manage **users, machines, groups, and OUs**, and simulate real-world IT administration tasks in a Windows domain environment.
