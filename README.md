# Active Directory Fundamentals (TryHackMe Lab)

This project documents my hands-on work in **TryHackMe Cyber Security 101** and **Windows & Active Directory Fundamentals** labs.  
The focus was on learning how to configure and manage **Active Directory (AD DS)**, apply **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**, manage **users, machines, groups, and OUs**, and simulate real-world IT administration tasks in a Windows domain environment.

# Lab Checklist

# Part 1: Active Directory Basics

### Core Concepts
- **AD DS** acts as a catalogue that holds all network objects (users, groups, machines, printers, shares).
- **Security Principals** (users, groups, machines) can be authenticated and assigned privileges.

ðŸ“¸ Example: Viewing AD DS in the Domain Controller

# Part 2: User & Machine Accounts

### Users
- Represent employees or services.
- Can be authenticated and assigned permissions.

### Machines
- Each domain-joined machine creates a machine account (e.g., `DC01$`).
- Passwords are long (120 characters) and auto-rotated.

ðŸ“¸ Example: Adding users in ADUC

# Part 3: Security Groups

- Groups simplify access management by granting privileges to multiple users/machines at once.
- Examples:
  - **Domain Admins** â€“ Admin privileges across domain.
  - **Backup Operators** â€“ Can access files for backup.
  - **Domain Users** â€“ All domain users.
  - **Domain Computers** â€“ All domain machines.

ðŸ“¸ Example: Security groups in AD

# Part 4: Organizational Units (OUs)

- OUs organize users/computers into logical structures.
- Used for applying **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**.
- Example structure created:
  - IT
  - Marketing
  - Sales
  - Management
  - R&D
  - Students (custom)

# Part 5: Delegation of Control

- Delegation allows junior IT staff to perform tasks without domain admin rights.
- Example: Allowing "Phillip" (IT Support) to reset user passwords in Sales OU.

ðŸ“¸ Example: Delegating password reset rights

# Part 6: Group Policy Objects (GPOs)

- **GPOs** apply configurations and security baselines.
- Examples implemented:
  - Restrict non-IT users from accessing **Control Panel**.
  - Auto-lock workstations after **5 minutes** of inactivity.
